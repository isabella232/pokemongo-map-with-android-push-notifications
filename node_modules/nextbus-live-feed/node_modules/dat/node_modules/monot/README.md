monot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jed/monot.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jed/monot)

monot creates [JavaScript dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), where each one is greater than the last (also known as _monotonically increasing_). These come in handy when uniqueness is more important than accuracy, such as for creating keys that need to be both unique and sortable.

The API of a monot date constructor is identical to JavaScript's built-in `Date`, allowing monot to be used as a drop-in replacement for `Date`.

Example
-------

```javascript
var monot = require("monot")
var MonotonicDate = monot()

// JavaScript dates are in milliseconds, which means that two
// created  in a tight loop could be identical...
console.log(new Date().toISOString()) // '2013-06-19T22:28:26.220Z'
console.log(new Date().toISOString()) // '2013-06-19T22:28:26.220Z'

// ...whereas monot dates always increase.
console.log(new MonotonicDate().toISOString()) // '2013-06-19T22:28:26.221Z'
console.log(new MonotonicDate().toISOString()) // '2013-06-19T22:28:26.222Z'
```

Installation
------------

    npm install monot

Usage
-----

### var MonotonicDate = monot(lastDate)

This creates a new monotonic Date constructor. All generated dates will be greater than _lastDate_ (which defaults to `Date.now()`). This constructor has the same API as the built-in Date constructor, but returns built-in Date instances.

```javascript
var monot = require("monot")
var Date = monot()

console.log(Date.now()) // 1371682752708
console.log(Date.now()) // 1371682752709
console.log(Date.now()) // 1371682752710

console.log(new MonotonicDate instanceof Date) // true
```
