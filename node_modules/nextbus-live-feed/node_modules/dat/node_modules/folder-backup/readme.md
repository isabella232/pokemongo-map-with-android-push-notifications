##API

### `fbackup.clone(remoteURL, options, cb)`

you can also specify `options.showProgress` as either `true` or `false` (default is `false`) if you want to print progress messages to stdout

### `fbackup.unpack`

the `extract` method exposed from the internal instance of the `tar-fs` module

### `fbackup.serve(dir, httpResponse, [cb])`

function for mounting this module in an http API. streams `fbackup.pack` of `dir` to the `httpResponse`, calls optional `cb` when done

### `fbackup.pack`
